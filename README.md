Usage
=======
First off, make sure that your img tag has the proper height and width of the image. It helps things run smoother. 

	Editr(image); //This parameter is just your img element. This alone will do nothing.
	
	Editr(image).sepia();//This will apply the sepia filter your your image


Two Types of usage

	Editr(image).sepia().replace(); //This replaces the image that was passed in at the spot
	
	Editr(image).sepia().dataURL(); //This will return the dataURL which you can then add as the src to any img tag in your site. 


Chainable

	Editr(image).sepia().grayScale().monoRed().replace() //This will go through each change and keep on applying the changes to the image and then replace the image.
